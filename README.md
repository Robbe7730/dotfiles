# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. They are mainly for personal backup, but also for you to
look at (and steal from).

## Structure

- `configs` contains all the config files that will be symlinked by the
  `install.sh` script (defined by `configs/targets.tsv`).
- `scripts` contains my scripts, but beware, a lot of these were written when I
  had barely any Bash/Python/... experience, so wear protective gear before
  entering.
- `copypasta` contains copypastas, what did you expect?
- `sounds` contains sounds used by my i3-soundboard.

## License

Everything in this repository is free to use, copy and do with as you please,
but referencing me would be nice :)

The sounds are not my own, nor are the contents of the copypastas, so I probably
cannot decide what right you have over them. But hey, I'm not a lawyer so I
won't be able to stop you either way.
